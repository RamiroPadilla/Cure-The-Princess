Problem:

Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a beautiful princess who had fallen gravely ill. The king and queen of the land tried everything in their power to cure her, but none of the remedies they tried seemed to work.

A group of local villagers approached the king and queen and told them about a set of magical ingredients that were said to have the power to cure any ailment. However, the villagers warned that these ingredients could be volatile in their effects, in addition, due to the recent droughts, only so many of the ingredients may be available at any given time, and only a skilled alchemist would be able to determine if a specific combination of these particularly volatile and scarce ingredients would to cure the princess.

The king and queen were desperate to save their daughter, so they set out to find the best alchemist in the land. They searched high and low and finally found an alchemist who had a reputation for being a master of a new magical art known as "Data Science and Machine Learning"

The alchemist first examined the claims of the villagers and the amounts they had taken of each ingredient, along with whether or not it had led to a cure. The alchemist knew that this was their one shot at curing the princess, and they had to get it right.

Goal:

The quantities taken of each of the below ingredients (features) are what we will use to predict:
Phoenix Feather
Unicorn Horn
Dragon's Blood
Mermaid Tears
Fairy Dust
Goblin Toes
Witch's Brew
Griffin Claw
Troll Hair
Kraken Ink
Minotaur Horn
Basellisk Scale
Chimera Fang

Which will let us determine the target variable which is:

Cured (whether the ingredients and quantity combination lead to a cure)
